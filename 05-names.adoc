Naming Rules is my favorite set of rules. They provide great benefits at low cost.
Name refactorings rarely cause things to break and with modern IDEs are quite an easy operation.

Proper naming has one major objective.
You should be able to have a reasonable expectation of what a class or a method is doing, just by reading its name.

Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.____
